      <button type="button" data-acc="r1" aria-expanded="false">
        <span><strong>4.1.1 Reflection 1:</strong> Professional Identity Development as a Business Consultant</span>
        <span class="chev">+</span>
      </button>
      <div id="r1" class="panel-content">
        <p>Among the critical lessons that the course has taught me, I have learned to form my professional identity as a business consultant and not just a technical SAP specialist. My role was previously perceived mainly in the functional dimension, where I paid attention to accuracy of configuration, solving problems, and system performance. I was able to acquire this knowledge in course activities and reflective tasks, and it taught me that effective consulting involves a wider viewpoint integrating technical knowledge with organisational aims and business results.</p>
        <p>This education has come in handy especially in transforming my approach to dealing with stakeholders. I do not just seek to understand the requirements of the systems but now I ask myself why the existence of a business process and how SAP solutions can help achieve strategic goals. This change has enabled me to put my contributions into the context of value creation as opposed to task accomplishment.</p>
        <p>This learning applies to my professional setting where I engage more goal-oriented questions when discussing a matter and explain SAP decisions using business language. This will enhance the trust of the stakeholders and make me a consultant who is knowledgeable in both technology and business requirements. The course has thus aided a significant shift in my perception about myself and the way I display my professional abilities.</p>
      </div>

      <button type="button" data-acc="r2" aria-expanded="false">
        <span><strong>4.1.2 Reflection 2:</strong> Communication and Stakeholder Management</span>
        <span class="chev">+</span>
      </button>
      <div id="r2" class="panel-content">
        <p>The course has contributed greatly to my knowledge of how to communicate and manage stakeholders effectively in a working environment. I have also understood that communication does not always mean sharing of information, but also regarding messages to various audiences and setting expectations. Formal communication methods that were brought up in the course assisted me to identify loopholes in my former method particularly when engaging with non-technical stakeholders.</p>
        <p>The value of this learning was realized in the consideration of the previous experiences of production support. Numerous obstacles were not technical in nature, but rather arose due to misinterpretation between business users and IT departments. The course strengthened the need to be clear, active listeners and ensure that there is a common understanding.</p>
        <p>Practically, I have been able to use this learning by organising conversations better, summarising the main points, and checking out expectations prior to starting to solve them. I also take better records on discussion in order to minimize ambiguity. The changes have enhanced cooperation and minimized duplication in my practice. Increased stakeholder communication is now a crucial skill that contributes to the success of operations and sustainability of professional credibility in the long term.</p>

      <button type="button" data-acc="r3" aria-expanded="false">
        <span><strong>4.1.3 Reflection 3:</strong> Teamwork and Cross-Functional Collaboration</span>
        <span class="chev">+</span>
      </button>
      <div id="r3" class="panel-content">
        <p>The cross-functional collaboration and teamwork became another main theme of the course. Group discussions demonstrated the value of different viewpoints in the resolution of problems and making decisions. I got to know that a team needs to work effectively and in order to do this, one needs to be open, respect other opinions and share responsibility instead of performing in seclusion.</p>
        <p>This learning is very practical to my working experience in global ERP setting, where the SD processes of SAP require close coordination with the teams of FI, MM, BASIS, and integration. The course made me consider instances when poor cooperation slowed down the results and when a good teamwork resulted in effective solutions.</p>
        <p>I now use this knowledge by being more proactive in working with cross-functional teams, providing contextual information as opposed to symptoms only, and recognizing the value of other people. I would also ensure to engage the concerned stakeholders in problem solving early. Such practices have enhanced working relations and quality of solving issues. The course reiterated the fact that effective consultation is not a one-person endeavor but one that requires working well together.</p>

      <button type="button" data-acc="r4" aria-expanded="false">
        <span><strong>4.1.4 Reflection 4:</strong> Problem-Solving and Decision-Making in Complex Environments</span>
        <span class="chev">+</span>
      </button>
      <div id="r4" class="panel-content">
        <p>The course reinforced my attitude to solving problems and making decisions in the complicated professional settings. I got to know organised ways of problem analysis, finding the root cause and assessing alternatives before taking an action. This learning opposed my past trends to consider short-term solutions especially with high-stress production support scenarios.</p>
        <p>This learning is useful because it enhances efficiency and quality of solution. Through the use of the structured analysis, I am in a better position to differentiate between the symptoms and the underlying problems. This eliminates repetitive issues and helps to achieve more sustainable results.</p>
        <p>I have now used these techniques in my professional life to manage SAP incidents by reviewing data, process flow, and system dependencies with a systematized approach to making changes. I also keep a record of decision rationales as a way of enhancing transparency and learning. This has helped me gain confidence in the decision-making process and has increased the confidence of stakeholders that depend on the right and consistent SAP resolutions.</p>

      <button type="button" data-acc="r5" aria-expanded="false">
        <span><strong>4.1.5 Reflection 5:</strong> Ethical Practice and Professional Responsibility</span>
        <span class="chev">+</span>
      </button>
      <div id="r5" class="panel-content">
        <p>Some of the themes that influenced my learning throughout the course were ethical practice and professional responsibility. I gained a better appreciation of the ethical aspect of professional decisions, especially concerning data integrity, access control and accountability. As noted in the course, ethical behaviour is not confined to compliance but is furthermore responsible judgment and professional practice.</p>
        <p>This education is particularly applicable in SAP setups in which consultants handle sensitive data and system access in business. I also realised that the impact of simple decisions (e.g. providing access to users or changes in master data) may be enormous in an organisation.</p>
        <p>In practice, I use this learning through the adherence to rigorous approval procedures, documentation of changes, and the expansion of the overall impact of my actions. I am also open in communicating with stakeholders in the case of identifying risks. This moral consciousness enhances my professional ethics and builds trust that is very vital in long term success as a business consultant.</p>

      <button type="button" data-acc="peer" aria-expanded="false">
        <span><strong>4.2</strong> PEER EVALUATION REFLECTION</span>
        <span class="chev">+</span>
      </button>
      <div id="peer" class="panel-content">
        <p>Feedbacks by peers indicated that I was a dependable team member who had good technical skills and a positive attitude when doing group work. My peers indicated that I was a clear communicator and I always made my contributions towards group outcome. Feedback on the other hand also revealed that I can be more active as a leader in discussion and introduce wider horizons.</p>
        <p>This feedback allowed me to think over the feedback and realise the significance of visibility and confidence in the workplace. To counter this, I have actively tried to contribute more in the discussion earlier, provide structured opinions and relate ideas to the overall goals. I have also trained on being more assertive in my expression and receptive to criticism.</p>
        <p>These transitions enhanced my interest and confidence in working in groups. The peer review exercise solidified the importance of reflective practice and gave me useful ideas which can help me continue to grow as a consultant.</p>
