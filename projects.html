    <h3>SAP S/4HANA SD IMPLEMENTATION / PRODUCTION SUPPORT CASE STUDY</h3>
  </article>

  <article class="card" style="grid-column: span 12;">
    <h3>Project background</h3>
    <p>This was a project whereby SAP S/4HANA SD production support was provided to global manufacturing customers Atlas Copco and Epiroc that operate in Europe, Asia and North America. The corporate landscape was extremely complicated, and the ERP systems, ecommerce systems and EDI interfaces were integrated and supported the high volume of sales orders, deliveries and billing. The reliability of the system and the prompt solution of the issues were crucial to the everyday business activity.</p>

    <h3>Challenge</h3>
    <p>The main issue was to have continuous order-to-cash flows and deal with frequent incidents, system improvements, cross-system dependencies. Some of the problems encountered included pricing discrepancies and billing malfunctions to processing of deliveries and ecommerce transactions. These issues necessitated the alignment of various ERP teams and the close observance of service-level agreements.</p>

    <h3> Project goals</h3>
    <p>The objectives of the project were to stabilise SAP SD functions, lessen incident resolution period, provide ecommerce capability, and provide proper data flow among SAP and other systems. Another goal was to enhance the end-user confidence by means of effective communication and training.</p>

    <h3> My Role</h3>
    <p>My work was related to functional support of SAP S/4HANA SD, analysis of incidents, and coordination of stakeholders. I was working with production tickets, assisted with the ecommerce monitoring, central administrative control, and cooperated with the FI, MM, EDI, and non-SAP ERP teams. I also advocated weekend patching and gave end user instructions with the ServiceNow ticketing.</p>

    <h3> My Approach</h3>
    <p>I used a mixture of systematic root-cause investigation, effective documentation, and active communication. To address the problems effectively, I applied SAP standard tools, background job monitoring, and master data validation methods. Some of the results were a better stability of the systems, quicker ticket resolutions, smoother ecommerce processes and better cooperation between IT and business users. This project enhanced my capability to provide business value in highly challenging, international ERP settings.</p>
