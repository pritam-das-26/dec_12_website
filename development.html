    <h3> PERSONAL &amp; PROFESSIONAL LEARNING GOALS (PPLG)</h3>
  </article>
  

  <article class="card" style="grid-column: span 12;">
    <h3>Personal Learning Goals</h3>
    <p>My individual learning objectives lie in enhancing communication, leadership, critical thinking, and adaptability, which are critical to successful work in the consulting positions. Although my technical background in SAP S/4HANA SD is quite good, I would like to develop my skills in conveying the complex system concepts in simple and business-oriented language. This is especially crucial in dealing with non-technical stakeholders and the top management. Another priority is leadership development. I want to go beyond personal contribution by becoming more involved in making decisions, coaching the junior team members, and more assertive in the strategy discussions. Critical thinking will continue to play a central role in my development, particularly in the ability to analyse business issues on a case-by-case basis instead of looking at the problems of the system in isolation. Flexibility is also important, since the global ERP environment requires flexibility to fluctuating priorities, technologies and organisational contexts.</p>

  <article class="card" style="grid-column: span 12;">
    <h3>Professional Learning Goals</h3>
    <p>As a professional, my learning objectives will be to acquire the higher SAP S/4HANA Sales and Distribution certification as well as other functional area certification. My future career goal is to become a senior consultant and functional lead where I will be able to impact the solution design and delivery. The ability to build good business consulting skills in the New Zealand market is one of the main goals, and I need to keep in touch with the international SAP projects in order to enhance my global experience.</p>
